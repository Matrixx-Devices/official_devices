## Matrixx Official maintainership Requirements:

<details>
<br>
<summary><b>General rules:</b> :arrow_down: </summary>

* All maintainers must have knowledge about source control tools such as *git* and *repo*.
* All maintainers must release device sources **publicly** at [**Matrixx-Devices**](https://github.com/Matrixx-Devices) on Github
* All sources must be fully synced (pushed to GitHub) **prior to** every official build release
* Device trees can be co-maintained
* All maintainers must test every build before release this including with testers if possible in order to avoid issues
* If some quality requirements can’t be passed, the maintainer must provide the reason for the exception while applying for maintainer status
* Maintainers must respect each other, any act of hate or abuse will be severely punished
* A forum thread (usually XDA) must be made using official template and contain all the device documentation such as installation steps, download links, sources

</details>

<details>
<br>
<summary><b>Communications :</b> :arrow_down: </summary>

* The team communicates using Telegram group chat that you'll get an invite to when applying 
* PMs should be avoided as much as possible so all users can participate in a discussion
* Don’t spam about any ETAs, upcoming source updates or features to add
* We encourage features to be added via pull request, so we can review code and decide to implement 
* Feature requests should be made using *Pull Requests* with a properly prepared and **tested** commits

</details>

<details>
<br>
<summary><b>Git and repo:</b> :arrow_down: </summary>

* Git trees should be maintained in a tidy and organized manner
* Official release branches must be named after current Android version, e.g. Android 14 -branch_name-> 14.0, this naming is mandatory
* In the case of incompatibility with current, already hosted device sources, maintainers will need to create a dedicated branch for their device on said repos (eg. *14.0-cepheus*)
* Maintainers are free to create additional backup/testing branches
* Original commit authorship must be maintained
* Commits must preserve proper and informative naming
* Commits must describe the change, especially reverts. Commits without proper messages are meaningless, showing that you have no actual idea what you’re doing. 
* Reverts without a message doesn’t let others know what problem it was causing and it is generally bad for community
* Rebasing and force-pushing is allowed as long as it doesn’t affect other users badly
* Don’t force-push main branch of a common dt repository until consulted with all maintainers using it
* When force-pushing a branch it is advised to create a copy of it just in case, named *'mybranch-old'* or *'mybranch-today's date'*
